Project: Customer Churn Analysis for a Subscription-Based Telecom Service Provider

Tools Used: Excel, Power BI

Description:
I conducted a customer churn analysis for a subscription-based telecom service provider, Databel. The project involved preparing a dataset of 7,000+ customer records for analysis by performing data cleaning and pre-processing using Excel.
Using Power BI, I created dynamic visualizations, including churn rate trend analysis, to identify key drivers of churn and potential opportunities to reduce churn in high churn locations. The insights gained from the analysis helped the telecom service provider to improve its customer retention strategies and minimize churn.
